# capstone_ibm

This is a capstone project in which I am setting up a fictituos company called SpaceY to compete SpaceX.
It is found that Elon Musk's SpaceX has unbeatable market share. Why?
SpaceX has saved its money by reusing the first stage.
This is the key point to their success, and a challenging price compared to the other players in the market.
I am trying to follow the same strategy and find whether a more comeptitive price can be offered.
The launch vehicle data has been collected by webscraping.
Followed by EDA, and visualization- plotly-Dash
Folium is used to find more relevant infromation that can contribute to select aperfect launchpad location.
Different machine learning algorithms are used.
Logistic regression is used and it's parametrs are fine tuned by GridSerachCV
Support Vector Machine is used and it's parameters are optimized my GridSerachCV
Decision tree is also tried out with different parameters.
KNN is also tested on the same data.
It is found that the best algorithm is to use decision tree classifier after comparing the accuracy and score of all 4 algorithms.
